Script that demonstrates automatic identification of physical storage media using Python and the Windows API. Only works on Windows! Requires the win32 api module, which can be installed using:

```
pip install pywin32
```

(Apparently at some point in time there was an alternative package named "pypiwin32", but I'm not entirely sure if it's still used).
